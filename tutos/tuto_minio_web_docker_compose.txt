 you want to access the console, you need to do two things:

    As instructed by the log message, you need to set a static console port using --console-address.
    You need to publish this port in the ports section of your docker-compose.yml.

That gives us:

version: "3.7"
services:
    minio-image:
        container_name: minio-image
        build:
            context: ./dockerfiles/dockerfile_minio
        restart: always
        working_dir: "/minio-image/storage"
        volumes:
            - ./Storage/minio/storage:/minio-image/storage
        ports:
            - "9000:9000"
            - "9001:9001"
        environment:
            MINIO_ROOT_USER: minio-image
            MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: minio-image-pass
        command: server /minio-image/storage --console-address :9001

Running the above docker-compose.yml, I can access the MinIO console at http://localhost:9001, and log in using the minio-image/minio-image-pass credentials.
